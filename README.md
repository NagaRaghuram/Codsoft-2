## Description

The **Tic-Tac-Toe** project is a simple yet engaging two-player game that simulates the classic Tic-Tac-Toe experience. Players can take turns marking a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O," aiming 
to align three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project highlights essential programming concepts such as game logic, user input handling, and basic 
artificial intelligence for single-player mode.

## Features

- Two-player mode (local play).
- Single-player mode against a basic AI opponent.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Validations for winning conditions and draws.
- Restart option to play multiple rounds without restarting the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NagaRaghuram/tic-tac-toe.git

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The first player to align three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
